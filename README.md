## 📖 Overview
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class to derive features from another class.
- **Parent (Superclass):** `Animal`
- **Child (Subclass):** `Bird` (Extends `Animal`)

## 📂 Project Structure
- `program1.java`: Contains the `Animal` class, the `Bird` subclass, and the `main` driver method.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com) installed.
2. **Download**: Clone or download the `program1.java` file.
3. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   javac program1.java
